To enhance the A-MACI system by allowing variable Voice Credits, we can introduce a new mechanism that ensures anonymity and anti-collusion while accommodating voters with different Voice Credits. Here's a comprehensive solution:

### Solution Overview

1. **Voter Registration and Voice Credit Assignment**: Each voter is registered with a unique identifier and assigned a specific Voice Credit value. This value can be based on factors such as the voter's reputation, contribution to the community, or other relevant criteria.

2. **Anonymous Voting Mechanism**: To maintain anonymity, each voter's vote is encrypted and combined with a random noise value. This ensures that even if an attacker tries to identify a voter, they cannot link the vote to the voter's identity.

3. **Weighted Voting System**: The weighted voting system ensures that voters with higher Voice Credits have more influence on the outcome of the vote. This is achieved by multiplying the voter's vote by their assigned Voice Credit value before aggregating the votes.

4. **Anti-Collusion Mechanism**: To prevent collusive voting, each voter's vote is checked against a set of predefined criteria. If a voter's vote does not align with their assigned Voice Credit value, it is flagged as suspicious and removed from the final tally.

5. **Post-Vote Verification**: After the voting period, the system performs a post-vote verification to ensure that the votes are valid and the outcome is accurate. This includes checking for any suspicious voting patterns and ensuring that the weighted voting system was correctly applied.
